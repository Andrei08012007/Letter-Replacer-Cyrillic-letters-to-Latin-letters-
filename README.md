# Letter-Replacer
An simple phyton program that replaces cyrillic letters with latin letters. 

This code cannot replace upper case letters and all, because it will loop otherwise. Tried to test and all and doesn't work, loops and breaks the replacer, making it useless. So yeah ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯


You may use code from it, but just don't fully steal it and make it like you did it please.
